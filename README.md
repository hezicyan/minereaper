# MineReaper (WIP)

This project aims to implement an intelligent AI of [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) games.

Cooperated with [zyx02](https://github.com/zyx02).

## Features

- Simple Minesweeper gaming in command line interface
- Calculate the probability that each cell in the current situation is mine
- AI automatically completes minesweeping (currently only for Beginner's level)

## TODO List

- Optimize the algorithm of probability calculating
- Implement a new method to calculate the porbability that each cell is an openning
- Implement a new method to calculate the expectation of winning after revealing a cell
- Optimize the gready algorithm using the above

## Compilation

TODO
